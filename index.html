        <p>Here we see our toolbar with 7 elements to it. The first element is our prompt which is refreshed every 12
            hours along with the gallery. Try draw somthing along based on that prompt with our next elements. The black
            sqaure you see is a color picker which changes our stroke color. The image next to it is our pen tool with
            the one beside being the eraser, click on these to use them. That long blue line indacts the stroke width
            move it along to find the right size. Finaly if your drawing just doesnt sit right with you hit clear to get
            a fresh new canvas, but if you like it click submit and sent it to the gallery. Now that you know what our
            toolbar does click on the drawing button in the navagation bar and get to `drawing.</p>
